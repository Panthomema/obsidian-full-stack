Hi, i'm Panthomema. I am using this vault to store relevant information about my journal becoming a web developer. Its main use will be getting together relevant links and information pieces. This journey is based on:

- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)
-  [Full Stack Developer Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/full-stack)

Also, other auxiliary resources, that will be listed as i start using them:

-  [Frontend Developer Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend)
-  [Backend Developer Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/backend)
-  [JavaScript Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/javascript)

So, i'll try to piece the information i get in blocks, to keep it organised, following TOP structure:

-  [[Foundations MOC]]
-
